# XMBSave API Reference

The `XMBSave` singleton is an AutoLoad injected into `project.godot` located at `res://addons/godot_xmb/scripts/api.gd`. You can call these variables and methods globally from any script.

## Properties

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `default_game_scene_path` | `String` | The default `.tscn` file path to swap to when starting a brand new game or if a save payload lacks a `scene_path`. |
| `current_save_id` | `String` | A UNIX-timestamp string uniquely identifying the active mounted save in `user://saves/`. Empty string if not saved yet. |
| `ui_protection` | `bool` | True by default. Forces the background UI to release keyboard / gamepad focus while the Save Menu is visible, drastically reducing navigation bleed bugs. |

## Menu Opening Methods

### `open_create_menu(scene_path := "")`
Instantiates and mounts the Create Menu layout. It accepts an optional `scene_path` argument that forces it to warp to a specific map upon finalizing. Otherwise, it uses `default_game_scene_path`. **Recommended for use from Title Screens.**

### `open_load_menu()`
Instantiates and mounts the Load Menu layout, populated dynamically by saves inside your user filesystem.

### `open_save_menu()`
Instantiates and mounts the active mid-game Save Menu, mapping empty slots visually for clean structural layouts and enabling the 'Overwrite', 'Create', 'Copy', and 'Delete' functions natively.

## Adapter Management Core

### `register_save_adapter(target: Object, capture_method: StringName, apply_method: StringName, icon_method: StringName)`
Registers a node `target` (typically `self`) that the plugin utilizes as a callback proxy when structuring its payloads.

### `unregister_save_adapter(target: Object)`
Flushes out the internal variables linked to an adapter ensuring memory leaks bypass if a node leaves the tree awkwardly.

## Manual Invocation Triggers

*(Note: The XMB UI manages these calls natively in standard implementations. Access them manually if writing auto-save structures.)*

### `save_new(extra_data: Dictionary = {}, icon: Image = null) -> bool`
Constructs a brand new folder footprint and ID, resetting current playtime, and forcing a transition into `pending_create_scene_path`. Useful for brand new journeys!

### `save_current_as_new(extra_data: Dictionary = {}, icon: Image = null) -> bool`
Identical logic to an overwrite save (preserving playtime and current level bindings), but intelligently allocates a brand new UNIX ID to separate its lineage. Used directly by "Empty Slots" nested mid-game.

### `_save_overwrite(id: String, extra_data: Dictionary = {}, icon: Image = null) -> bool`
Directly writes or overwrites to a specific UUID `id`, pushing a newly captured play state to disk.

### `copy_save(id: String) -> bool`
Perfectly encapsulates cloning a targeted payload and icon context into an entirely disjoint UUID slot.

### `delete_save(id: String) -> void`
Erases a save metadata node fully.

## Utility Functions

### `get_current_playtime() -> float`
Retrieves the realtime floating delta timer tracked globally.

### `has_saves() -> bool`
Checks whether `user://saves/` contains any valid payload data yet. Useful to toggle "Continue" vs "New Game" buttons.

### `is_menu_open() -> bool`
Identifies internally whether any Save CanvasLayer matches are aggressively mounted.

## Signals

* `save_loaded(save_id: String, save_data: Dictionary)` - Fired after processing the scene switch out of the loader.
* `save_written(save_id: String, save_data: Dictionary)` - Fired cleanly after hitting the file system during Create/Overwrite/Copy passes.
* `save_deleted(save_id: String)` - Fired upon erasing an `id` directory tree.
